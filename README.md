### Development Instructions

To setup, please install python 3.12 and [sass](https://sass-lang.com/install/) first.

Then, run the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the dev server, run the following command:

```bash
python3 serve.py
```

To build the frontend into static html, run the following command:

```bash
python3 serve.py --build-only
```

Note: You should NEVER edit files in `P1`. These files are generated. You should always edit files in `src`, and running the script will update the generated files automatically.
